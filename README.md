# BumpCar - Backend

## What is BumpCar?

Bumpcar is online shop inspired by [AutoDiler](https://www.autodiler.me). Its created as a final project for Developers Lab's [Django Course](https://developers-lab.me/kurs/backend-django-v2). This is it's REST API built with [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org).

## Setup

To install the project localy you need to do couple of things:

-   Make sure you have Python version > 3.0.0 installed on your machine, as well as Git and IDE ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm) would be prefered).
-   Since this app uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) as DBSM, you will have to install it localy as well.
-   Choose your working directory and clone the project from `main` branch.
-   Activate `venv`, then install all the dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
-   Using [Psql CLI](https://www.postgresguide.com/utilities/psql) or [PgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org) execute `db_setup.sql` and `db_startup.sql` from `sql` folder to setup your database and set the admin user.
-   Create `.env` by copying `.env.example` to set all of the necessary enviroment variables. Keep in mind that this `.env` is used ONLY for development, to get production variables ask the owner.
-   Run your app using `python manage.py runserver` (this may vary depending of your OS) or `gunicorn bumpcar.wsgi` (recommended).
-   Thats it, let us know if you have some issues, happy coding :)
